# Introduction to Machine Learning

See .py files for code. Basic backend implementation of the following machine learning concepts. Application can be seen in some PDFs in the folders. 

*HW2*
- KMeans (kmeans.py)
- Gaussian Mixture Models (gmm.py)

*HW3*
- Feature reduction (featurereduction.py)
- Image compression (imgcompression.py)
- Naive Bayes (nb.py)
- Principal Component Analysis (nca.py)
- Logistic regression (regression.py)

*HW4*
- Neural networks (nn.py)
- Random forests (random_forest.py)
